<h3 id="Heading-3">Environmental Prevention</h3>
<p>	Schistosomiasis is spread through water containing schistomes from feces. We can prevent this by implementing plumbing systems where Schistosomiasis continuously happens. With the plumbing systems people in underdeveloped countries won't throw their waste into rivers and lakes and hinder the spread of Schistosomiasis.
