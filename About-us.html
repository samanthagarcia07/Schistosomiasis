<div id="my_paragraph"> We are high school students from different schools around the bay area. We applied for a STEM summer program which is a commitment for three years every summer for five weeks to learn about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. In those five weeks we show our knowledge by working on a project about infectious diseases that was was put together in our biology, math, computer science, and design thinking classes. SMASH also provides the experience of living in the dorms of Stanford, a college that is located in Palo Alto. </div>
