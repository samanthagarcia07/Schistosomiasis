	<h2>Individual Behavioral Prevention</h2>
	<p> Since Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease the best ways to prevent infection are:
	<li>Avoid swimming/drinking out of contaminated of bodies of freshwater.
	<li>Bring contaminated freshwater to a boil of 145 degrees for 15-20 seconds.	
	<li>Vigorious towel drying ay help after brief skin exposure of contaminated water.

<h3 id="Heading-3">Environmental Prevention</h3>
<p>	Schistosomiasis is spread through water containing schistomes from feces. We can prevent this by implementing a plumbing systems where Schistosomiasis continuously happens. With the plumbing systems people in underdeveloped countries won't throw their waste into rivers and lakes and hinder the spread of Schistosomiasis.
