	<h1>Background Information </h1>
	<h2>History</h2>
	
	<p>Schistosomiasis was discovered by Theodor Maximilian Bilhars in 1851. He was a German physisian and pathologis. He worked in many different hospitals in Cairo,Germany.During an autotopsy he found an unknown parasite whic consisted of white bumps in the mucous membranes of the bladder,ureter, and intestine. In 1852, Karl Theodor Ernst Von Siebold wrote a paper summerizing Theordors findings and later published the detailed information in 1853.  </p>

	<h3>Life Cycle</h3>
	<p>Schistosomiasis consists life cylces of five human shistosome species which invole a snail intermediate host.Human or animal hosts get infected when they come in contact with contaminated freshwater.The parasite are typically in feces or in urine. Their eggs are hached and release miracidia which swim and penetrate the snail tissue. The stages in the snail include 2 generations of Sporocysts along with the production of cercariae. The infective cercariae are released by the snail and swim freely, and eventually attach to the skin penetrating the host, losing its tail and becoming a schistomulae.</p>

	<h4>Symptoms</h4>
	The impact of the infection depends on the stage of the worm and the stage of the infection. The symptoms of the inflammatory stage usually occur about 3-8 weeks after the infection. They include a rash, fever, headache, body aches,or myalgia, and breathing difficulties. Many don't show symptoms during that stage but may develope symptopms as the disease progresses(also depending on the parasite). The cronic stage involves diarrhea/constipation, blood in feces, intestinal ulcers,liver fibrosis, portal hypertension,or high blood pressure around the digestive system if the liver or intestines are affected. Blood in the urine,painful urination, and a higher risk of bladder cancer can occur if the parasites affect the urinary systemIn rare cases anemia can develope over time if the parasite affects the central nervous system.
