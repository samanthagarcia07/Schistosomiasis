	<h1>Background Information </h1>
	<h2>Life Cycle</h2>
	
	<p> Schistosomiasis consists life cylces of five human shistosome species which invole a snail intermediate host.Human or animal hosts get infected when they come in contact with contaminated freshwater.The parasite are typically in feces or in urine. Their eggs are hached and release miracidia which swim and penetrate the snail tissue. The stages in the snail include 2 generations of Sporocysts along with the production of cercariae. The infective cercariae are released by the snail and swim freely, and eventually attach to the skin penetrating the host, losing its tail and becoming a schistomulae.</p>
